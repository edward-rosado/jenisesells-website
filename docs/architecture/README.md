## Agent site comprehensive design (PR #155, R3)

Diagrams supporting the comprehensive agent site design spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-12-agent-site-comprehensive-design.md`. The spec contains 34 total Mermaid diagrams; these four are surfaced here as the ones most useful to implement against.

| Document | Description |
|----------|------------|
| [Voiced Content Generator Lifecycle](voiced-content-generator-lifecycle.md) | Request/response sequence for the new `IVoicedContentGenerator` abstraction — cache, schema validation, fair housing linter, retry, fallback. Eliminates ~15 duplicate Claude call sites across T3 polish fields. |
| [Routing Policy next_lead CAS](routing-policy-next-lead-cas.md) | Two leads racing on a shared `next_lead` manual override — only one consumes it via `SaveIfUnchangedAsync` CAS, the other falls through to algorithmic routing. |
| [AccountConfig ETag Concurrency](account-config-etag-concurrency.md) | Two brokerage join writers racing on `account.json` — reuses the existing `ITokenStore` ETag pattern (`AzureTableTokenStore.SaveIfUnchangedAsync` + 412 retry loop). |
| [BYOD Two-Phase Verification](byod-two-phase-verification.md) | Bring Your Own Domain lifecycle — TXT challenge for ownership, CNAME for routing, Cloudflare for SaaS provisioning, daily re-verification, suspended/removed transitions. |

## API Project Structure (44+ Projects + 34 Test Projects)

The .NET 10 backend (`apps/api/`) is split into 44+ isolated production projects and 34 test projects following a strict dependency graph:

| Layer | Projects | Depends On |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Domain** | `RealEstateStar.Domain` | Nothing (pure models, interfaces, enums) |
| **Data** | `RealEstateStar.Data` | Domain only |
| **DataServices** | `RealEstateStar.DataServices` | Domain only |
| **Workers** | `Workers.Shared`, `Workers.Lead.Orchestrator`, `Workers.Lead.CMA`, `Workers.Lead.HomeSearch`, `Workers.WhatsApp`, + 16 Activation workers | Domain + Workers.Shared |
| **Activities** | `Activities.Pdf`, `Activities.Persist`, `Activities.Activation.PersistAgentProfile`, `Activities.Activation.BrandMerge` | Domain + Workers.Shared |
| **Services** | `Services.AgentNotifier`, `Services.LeadCommunicator`, `Services.AgentConfig`, `Services.BrandMerge`, `Services.WelcomeNotification` | Domain only |
| **Clients** | `Clients.Anthropic`, `Clients.Scraper`, `Clients.WhatsApp`, `Clients.GDrive`, `Clients.Gmail`, `Clients.GDocs`, `Clients.GSheets`, `Clients.GoogleOAuth`, `Clients.Stripe`, `Clients.Cloudflare`, `Clients.Turnstile`, `Clients.Azure`, `Clients.Gws`, `Clients.RentCast` | Domain only (own internal DTOs) |
| **Api** | `RealEstateStar.Api` | Everything (sole composition root) |

Key rules:
- **Domain owns ALL interfaces** — storage, client, sender contracts
- **Api is the sole composition root** — only project that wires DI bindings
- **Each Client has its own DTOs** — maps to Domain types internally, no leaking
- **Architecture enforced** at compile-time (csproj refs) and CI-time (ArchUnit tests in `tests/RealEstateStar.Architecture.Tests/`)
- **1175+ tests** across 23 test projects (1:1 with production projects + `Architecture.Tests` + `TestUtilities`)
